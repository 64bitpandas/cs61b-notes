# Access Control

**Definition:** Specifying the specific level of access of methods and variables.

**Benefits**
 - Self documenting
 - Safe to change private methods without worrying about external calls
 - Specifies to users that private code does not need to be understood or used by them

### Nested Classes
 - Putting a class inside of another class
 - Nested classes can be set to `private` in order to do access control
 - Static classes cannot access the outside class
