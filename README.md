# Welcome

## Welcome to 64bitpanda's CS61B Guide!

\(If you are looking at this in github, go to [cs61b.bencuan.me](https://cs61b.bencuan.me) for a much better experience!\)

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to data structures, specifically topics covered in [CS61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b). Main topics include:

* Object oriented programming basics
* Abstract data types
* Asymptotics and runtime analysis
* Sorting algorithms
* Search algorithms
* And some more miscellaneous topics thrown in!

This guide is written to be as easy to follow and digestible as possibleüòÄI've included lots of diagrams, practice problems, and more intuitive explanations instead of the more straightforward approach most textbooks use. **This isn't a replacement for lectures and other course content.** You probably need to look at those first, and come here if something isn't sticking!

## Who is this for?

Mostly me; making unnecessarily detailed guides is my goto method of making sure I understand everythingüòÅBut you are welcome to use it as well for reviewing for 61B exams, touching up on data structures knowledge, or whatever you want!\*

**Do note that basic knowledge gained from** [**CS61A**](https://cs61a.org/) **or equivalent is assumed.** [Click here](https://64bitpandas.github.io/cs61a) for my notes for that!
