# Welcome

## Welcome to 64bitpanda's CS61B Guide!

\(If you are looking at this in github, go to [cs61b.bencuan.me](https://cs61b.bencuan.me) for a much better experience!\)

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to data structures, specifically topics covered in [CS61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b). Main topics include:

* Object oriented programming basics
* Abstract data types
* Asymptotics and runtime analysis
* Sorting algorithms
* Search algorithms
* And some more miscellaneous topics thrown in!

This guide is written to be as easy to follow and digestible as possibleüòÄI've included lots of diagrams, practice problems, and more intuitive explanations instead of the more straightforward approach most textbooks use. **This isn't a replacement for lectures and other course content.** You probably need to look at those first, and come here if something isn't sticking!

### The 61B Concept Map

## Who is this for?

Mostly me; making unnecessarily detailed guides is my goto method of making sure I understand everythingüòÅBut you are welcome to use it as well for reviewing for 61B exams, touching up on data structures knowledge, or whatever you want!\*

**Do note that basic knowledge gained from** [**CS61A**](https://cs61a.org/) **or equivalent is assumed.** [Click here](https://64bitpandas.github.io/cs61a) for my notes for that!

## How to use this guide

Again, I will emphasize that this **isn't a textbook.** While I try to be as comprehensive as possible, I'm sure I missed plenty of important concepts or assume you know others. I don't have an army of peer reviewers and guinea pigs to test-read the thing, so it's also not guaranteed that everything is 100% accurate. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/64bitpandas/cs61b-notes/issues) if you think something's wrong!

{% hint style="warning" %}
For more difficult topics, I'll put a warning like this at the top of the page with links to prerequisites or supporting topics so that you won't feel completely lost üòâ
{% endhint %}

There are also plenty of practice problems to try out! Here's an non-exhaustive list of pages with those if you are mostly interested in them and not the conceptual content.

* [Access Control](oop/access-control.md#practice)
* [Dynamic Method Selection](oop/dynamic-method-selection.md)
* [Generic Types](oop/generics.md#generic-subtypes)
* [Asymptotics Practice](asymptotics/asymptotics-practice.md)
