# Welcome

### Welcome to 64bitpanda's CS61B Guide!

This is a **non-comprehensive** guide to data structures, specifically topics covered in [CS61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b). Main topics include:

* Object oriented programming basics
* Abstract data types
* Asymptotics and runtime analysis
* Sorting algorithms
* Search algorithms
* And some more miscellaneous topics thrown in!

### Who is this for?

Mostly me; making unnecessarily detailed guides is my goto method of making sure I understand everythingüòÅ   
But you are welcome to use it as well for reviewing for 61B exams, touching up on data structures knowledge, or whatever you want!\*
