# Inheritance

## What is inheritance?

Essentially, it's a way of putting similar objects together to **generalize behavior.** Inheritance is best used with relating **subtypes** to larger categories. For example, an üçäorange **is a** fruit \(so it's a **subtype** of fruit\). 

Let's say that a supermarket named _Jrader Toe's_ asks us to simulate fruits for them in an online system. We could do it like this:

![The naive approach.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

Now, every fruit would need some of the same properties- like cost, weight, and name! So we would need to do something like:

```java
public class Orange {
    private String name = "Orange";
    private int cost;
    ...
    public Orange(int cost, ...) {
        this.cost = cost;
        ...
    }
    // lots of methods
    public String getName() { ...
```

This would be _really annoying_ to do for every single fruit! And they're all the same properties for every fruit so it would also be incredibly inefficient code-wise. **Inheritance gives a much better solution!**

Let's make a **Fruit** class and have all of our fruits **inherit from** that class.

![uwu inheritance is cool and good](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

This does amazing things because we can just create one single Fruit class that has all of the properties we need, and simply make our specific fruits inherit those properties.

```java
public class Fruit {
    private String name;
    private int cost;
    ...
    public Orange(String name, int cost, ...) {
        this.name = name;
        this.cost = cost;
        ...
    }
    // lots of methods
    public String getName() { ...
}

// Now for a very simple Orange method!
public class Orange extends Fruit {
    public Orange(int cost,...) {
        super("Orange", cost, ...);
    }
}
```

With only those 4 lines, üçäOrange now has all of the same methods and properties that Fruit has!

## Method Overriding

Let's say that _Jrader Toe's_ is running a promotion for üçêpears and wants to make them 20% off normal pears! This poses a problem because **we want to inherit everything that normal pears have, but change only one behavior** \(getPrice\). Well I've got the solution for you!!! And it's called **overriding.**

```java
public class PromoPear extends Pear {
    public PromoPear(int cost, ...) {
        super(cost, ...);
    }
    
    // Overriding the getPrice to have a new behavior only for PromoPears!
    @Override
    public int getPrice() {
        return super.getPrice() * 0.8;
    }
    ...
}   
```

The `@Override` tag is technically optional, but it's highly suggested because it makes sure that you are indeed overriding something and not just making a new method! \(Remember, it has to have the **same name and parameters as a method in one of its parents**.\)

## **Method Overloading**

Sometimes, you want to take in **different parameters** into the **same method.** For instance, what if we wanted to create a method `getCount(Fruit fruit)` that counts how many fruits of that type we have? We might also want to allow users to pass in the name of the fruit to do the same thing- `getCount(String fruit)`. Java will allow us to make **both** of these methods in the same class!

However, this has some major downsides that should be considered. 

* It's repetitive.
* It requires maintaining more code- changing one overload won't change the others!
* You can't handle any data types other than the ones you explicitly specify will work.

We'll discuss better solutions further down the page as well as in the [Generic Types](generics.md) page!

### How is overriding different from overloading?

They have very similar names but pretty different uses!

Overriding is for methods of the same name, **same parameters**, and **different classes.** If you can remember when you use the `@Override` tag, you can relate it back to this concept!

Overloading is for methods of the same name, **different parameters**, in the **same class**. 

## Interfaces

* Declared in the same way as classes: `public interface InterfaceName {}`
* Specifies the methods and variables contained, but not their implementation 
  * Can use **default** keyword to go around this restriction, but not recommended \(**Implementation inheritance**\)
    * Harder to keep track of implementation
    * Overly complex
    * Breaks encapsulation rules
* Allows generic types to be used in methods without overloading \(as long as they have the same methods\)
* **Method Overriding:** redefining the same methods in subclass as in superclass.
  * Priority will be given to subclass methods
  * Optional `@Override` tag helps with error checking and readability
  * **IMPORTANT:** Overridden methods MUST have the same signature!
* **Interface inheritance:** Term for specifying capabilities of subclasses using an interface
  * Subclasses must implement/override **all** of the interface methods!!
* **If X is a superclass of Y, then a variable of type X can hold a reference to Y!**
  * Uses methods from subclass
  * **Dynamic method selection:** Dynamic \(runtime\) types take priority over Static \(compiled\) types
* Example:

  ```java
  public interface AnInterface<Item> {
    public void doStuff(Item x);
    public Item getItem();
    default public void defaultStuff() {
        // Do stuff
    }
    ...
  }

  public class Something implements AnInterface<Item> {
   @Override
   public void doStuff(Item x) {
       // implement method
   }

   @Override
   public void getItem() {
       // implement method
   }
  }

  public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnInterface<String> smth = new AnInterface<>();
        AnInterface<String> smthElse = new Something<String>(); // Will not error!
        smth.getItem();
        ...
    }
  }
  ```

## Implementation Inheritance \(Extends\)

* Used to specify a **hyponym** of an interface
* Adds new functionality to a superclass
* What is inherited:
  * All instance and static variables
  * All methods
  * All nested classes
* What is NOT inherited:
  * Private variables/methods
  * Constructors
* Constructors will **automatically** run the constructor of superclasses even if it is not explicitly called!!!
  * Will not run twice if explicitly called: can access non-default constructors this way
* **IMPORTANT:** Any class which does not explicitly extend another class will implicitly extend the Object class

```java
public class A {
    public void doSomething() { ... }
}

public class B extends A {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        super.doSomething();
        // Do more things
    }

    public void doSomethingElse() { ... }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    A aa = new A();
    aa.doSomething(); // OK
    aa.doSomethingElse(); // ERROR
    B bb = new B();
    bb.doSomething(); // OK
    bb.doSomethingElse(); // OK
}
```

## Compile-Time Type Checking

* Compiler is more conservative about type checking than is actually allowed based on dynamic type checking
* Example:

  ```java
  B bb = new B();
  A aa = bb; // ALLOWED at compile time, since B is a subclass of A
  aa.doSomethingElse(); // NOT ALLOWED at compile time even though this would work!
  B AnotherBB = aa; // NOT ALLOWED at compile time because aa is assigned type A, and a static-type subclass cannot be dynamically assigned a superclass!
  ```

* Can be resolved using **Casting:** Telling Java to treat an expression like having a different compile-time type. In the example above, the last line can be changed to

  ```text
  B AnotherBB = (B)aa;
  ```

  which tells Java to treat aa like a B type class. Since aa is indeed type B, it will compile and run as expected.

  However, aa cannot be casted into an unrelated type, e.g. `String`. Doing so will result in a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

## Subtype Polymorphism

**Polymorphism:** Providing a single interface to entities of different types

* Common example: making objects extend a 'comparable' interface which specifies greater than, equals, etc. behaviors

**Dynamic method selection:** When using polymorphisms, Java selects the correct behavior based on the dynamic type, not the static type
